### FAQ

### 1 Staking

#### 1.1 What happens if I do not put GARY in a vault?

Your GARY will start to debase from the moment you purchase them - for example if the debase rate is 7% per day, you will own 7% less GARY the day after purchase. For this reason, it is highly recommended you put your GARY in a vault as soon as possible. Please read the tokenomics page for more details on the current debase rate(s).

#### 1.2 Civil Action vs Wells Notice. Which one should I go for?

If you have got the cash, Civil Action is usually preferable. You will need to deposit an equal amount of both $GARY and $HEX, whereas Wells Notice only requires $GARY.

#### 1.3 Will putting in more money increase the length of my lock period?

Whenever you make a deposit into a vault, the lock timer will reset, so if you already have GARY locked in a vault and deposit more into the same vault, the timer will reset.

#### 1.4 When I withdraw from Civil Action or Wells Notice, I have less GARY than when I deposited - why is this?

Eggs in Civil Action and Wells Notice will continue to debase despite being in a vault, so when you withdraw there may be less GARY in the vault. Because the GARY are in a vault, you will be accumulating GARY in the form of rewards, which may be greater than the number of GARY lost to debase, depending on the current APR. Read the tokenomics page and FAQ section for up-to-date numbers on debase rate etc.

#### 1.5 Do the rewards in vaults get debased too?

Rewards will only start to debase after you claim them; they are fully protected until then.

#### 1.6 Will making a claim extend my lock period?

Whenever you claim rewards, the lock timer will reset.

#### 1.7 What happens when the locking period ends for a vault?

Nothing changes at the end of the locking period, it simply means you can withdraw from the vault when you like. For example, if you are in Richard Heart is Always Right, your GARY will remain fully protected after the locking period ends. You do not need to re-stake in order to keep the GARY in a vault.

### 2 Tokenomics

#### 2.1 Will I gain GARY in Civil Action or Wells Notice?

In both, your GARY are exposed to debase as well as earning rewards, which means your ROI will depend on the current debase rate, the rewards, your size of the staking pool and how much TVL currently is competing for the fixed rewards. Note that for Civil Action, 50% of the value being locked is in GARY, and the other 50% is in HEX.

#### 2.2 Civil Action Example

**GARY scenario assuming no rewards:**

* Total supply: 100 GARY
* 20 GARY in LP paired with 20 HEX
* 1 EGGS = 1 HEX
* The rest staked in Wells Notice Vault (80 GARY)

**Assuming no one buys or sells and supply debases by 50% this happens:**

* Total supply: 50 GARY
* 10 GARY in LP paired with 20 HEX
* 1 GARY = 2 HEX (now worth more in HEX)
* The rest staked in Wells Notice Vault (40 GARY)

### 3 Rug Proofing

#### 3.1 Can the contracts change at any time?

Degens Care will implement a 3-day timelock on the contracts, so if any changes are made there must be a 3 day wait period before they can be executed. This means there cannot be any quick changes to rug the community.

#### 3.2 Do the developers/team own a large proportion of tokens?

No - initial GARY tokens were fairly distributed among the community. Please read the tokenomics page for more details.

#### 3.3 I just checked my wallet and I have less GARY than before, without any on-chain txns, am I being hacked?

No - the GARY token contract is written to debase during every block, so if you do not put your GARY in a vault, your GARY will start to disappear, without any on-chain transactions.
