### What is Gary? ðŸ¥š

GARY is an experiment in DeFi. The Gary Genslers of the world have been running the show for far too long. GARY gets debased every block. It's time to lock him up.

#### **What consequences does the debase have?**

The debase will increase the value of your GARY automatically if no one is selling. Debase affects the GARY that are in the LP, therefore the number of GARY in the LP will decrease over time while the amount of PLS remains constant.

### What do you do with GARY?

Degens CareÂ© offers three top-tier vaults to safeguard your Gary Token and earn rewards. Every block, 10M rewards are emitted. The Wells Notice Vault receives 1/10 of the rewards with a 24-hour lockup period. And for the daring degens, the Civil Action Vault offers an impressive 9/10 of the rewards for providing liquidity on PulseX. Finally, the Richard Heart Vault provides full protection against debasement, but no rewards, and a 7 day lockup period.
