# Why Gary?

Yes - GARY is inspired by $EGGs. But there are a few reasons why we prefer GARY:

* GARY will not be launched on any other chain except PulseChain. It is a mistake to deploy on multiple chains and dilute the value of the original product.
* The Hexican community is unique in its energy, capacity to hold, and potential for growth. There is not a single community in DeFi that understands the value of holding like Hexicans do. Gary, by design, can aggressively increase in price in bull markets.
* Civil Action Vault requires PLS as the LP pairing, which creates additional buy pressure on PLS as GARY succeeds.
* **Don't underestimate the power of a Meme!**

Please note:

* Degens Care is completely new and unaffiliated with any DeFi/Crypto/Web3 project in the space. Any rumors suggesting otherwise is false.
