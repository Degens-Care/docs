# Why Gary?

Yes - Gary is a fork of EGGs. But there are a few reasons why GARY is a more attractive investment, especially for Pulsechain natives:

* GARY will not be launched on any other chain except PulseChain. It is a mistake to deploy on multiple chains and dilute the value of the original product.
* The Hexican / Pulsican community is unique in its energy, capacity to hold, and potential for growth. There is not a single community in DeFi that understands the value of holding like Hexicans do. Gary, by design, can aggressively increase in price in bull markets.
* Civil Action Vault requires HEX as the LP pairing, which creates additional buy pressure on HEX as GARY succeeds. A small thank you to HEX.
* Last but not least, this token represents the potential to make a statement that the Gary Genslers of the world will not stop us.

Please note these considerations:

* Degens Care is completely new and unaffiliated with any DeFi/Crypto/Web3 project in the space. Any rumors suggesting otherwise is false.
* Gary is a satirical project. Don't take it too seriously!
